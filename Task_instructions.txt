Intro:

Implement a place recognition pipeline using LiDAR data from a publicly available dataset. The goal is to design a descriptor for LiDAR scans, implement a matching algorithm, and evaluate the system using standard performance metrics.



Tasks:

Descriptor Implementation

Design and implement a descriptor that captures the geometric structure of a LiDAR scan.
Matching Algorithm

Implement a similarity measure to compare descriptors.
Create a retrieval mechanism to find the most similar places in the database.


Evaluation
Define ground truth for place matches.



Compute:

Precision and Recall.
F1-score.
Average Precision (AP).
ROC curve or PR curve.
Analyze performance under different conditions (e.g., varying thresholds, different environments).


Deliverables:

Source code for descriptor and matching algorithm.
A short report including:
Description of your method.
Evaluation results with plots (Precision-Recall curves, etc.).
Discussion of strengths and weaknesses.
